            Hello there and welcome to my 
            45rom record collection.
            I used to be a bit of a record 
            collector,but about 4 years ago I went 
            digital(which isn't quite the same 
            as dylan going electric,
            but it was a big change).I subsequently
             sold off most of my collection.
            Anyway,I was loking for an excuse to play
             around with some infographics using only CSS
            (plus a few background images)so I chose what's left

        </span>
        <span class="first">
            of my 7th singles.
            I have 198 records left,which are a mixture of Funk,soul,RnB,
            Reggae,Jazz and latin.I have displayed them using a variety of
            statistics which can be seen below.
            For the record:This page has no semantic value,it's just a bit of fun,done purely
            for my own enjoyment (and hopefully yours).
            Enjoy your stay.
