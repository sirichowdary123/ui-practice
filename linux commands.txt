LINUX FILE SYSTEM :
-------------------
It is a structured collection of files on a disk drive or a partition.
We generally use of computers to store the data.so that we can easily access
files in less time. 
It consists of the following categories
=> / *root directory*
=> (EXT3, EXT4, BTRFS, XFS ....) *some specific storage format * 


LINUX FILE SYSTEM STRUCTURE:
***************************
Linux file system has of hierarchial file structure.
It contains a root directory and subdirectories.
Linux file system contains two-part file system software implementation architcture.
                   KERNAL
              VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEM
        EXT3  HPFS  VFAT EXT4  FREEBSD
                  HARDWARE
KERNAL:
*******
A Kernal is the central part of an operating system.It manages the operations of the
computer and the hardaware.
Kernals also provide services which programs can use through system calls.
VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEM:
********************
It is the software layer in the kernal that provides the file system interface to userspace programs.
HARDWARE:
********
It is the most visible part of information system.

TYPES OF LINUX FILE SYSTEM:
***************************
1.Ext,Ext2,Ext3 and Ext4 file system
2.JFS file system
3.ReiserFS file system
4.XFS file system
5.Btrfs file system
6.Swap file system

=>Ext,Ext2,Ext3 and Ext4 file system:
 Ext stands for extended file system.It was developed for MINIX OS.
Ext2 allows managing two terabytes of data.
Ext3 is an upgraded version of Ext2
Ext4 is a faster file system and it is very compatible for solid state drive.
=>JFS file system:
JFS stands for journaled file system.It is developed by IBM for AIX Unit.It is an alternative of Ext,Ext4 file system.cpu power is limited.
=>ReiserFS file system:
It is an alternative of Ext3.It was used as the default file system in SUSE Linux,suse returned to Ext3.
=>XFS file system:
It was considered as high-speed JFS,developed for both i/o processing.
=>Btrfs file system:
It stands for B tree file system.It is used for tolerance,fun administration,extensive storage configuration.
=>Swap file system:
It is used for memmemory paging Linux OS.It never goes in to hybernate
